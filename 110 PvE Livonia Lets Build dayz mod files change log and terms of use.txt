Using these modded xml files could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

THEME: Before the Zombie Apocalypse overan the country, large transport trucks & small 4x4's were sent into Chernarus packed with building materials to help the military, local services and the general populace secure their homes and prepare defences. Civilians also started to prepare for food shortages by filling their vehicles with food, hunting, fishing and cooking items so they could attempt to become self suffiecient. 

Apart from exceptions below, loot is vanilla - making survival a real challenge unless you find the tools to hunt, fish or farm.

Extra loot is based around finding vehicles, which are plentiful - which should make this set of xmls much easier to update, but still give some quality of life improvements for beginners.

This will be a harder DayZ than the one offered in previous xml mod packs I have created - but as the theme of Offical 1.10 is to take DayZ down a more survival path, I wanted to follow that too. You'll have to scavenge more for resources - food, weapons and ammo.
